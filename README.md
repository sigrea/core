# @sigrea/core

`@sigrea/core` is an in-progress, signal-driven reactivity library built on top of [alien-signals](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals). The project is still in a prototyping phase; public APIs and runtime behavior are subject to significant change, and the package has not been published to npm.

## Project Status

- Focus is currently on validating the core signal primitives
- Expect breaking changes until the API surface stabilizes
- Documentation and tutorials will be added once the design settles

## Development Notes

- Required tooling: Node.js 20+ and pnpm 10+
- Run `pnpm install` inside this directory before working on the package
- Use `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, or other scripts as needed while iterating
