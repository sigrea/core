## Tasks
- [x] Extract behavioural requirements from legacy `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `batch`, `readonly`, and lifecycle helpers.
- [x] Author specifications for each capability under `specs/` covering lifecycle, dependency tracking, batching, and exports.
- [x] Outline follow-up implementation work: create packages, migrate tests, and wire barrel exports via `packages/index.ts` and root `index.ts`.
- [x] Validate the proposal with `openspec validate --strict`.
